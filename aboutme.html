				<h3>Student, Dreamer, Activist</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Noah Acosta, my pronouns are He/Him/His and it is a
					pleasure to meet you virtually! I am a Computer Science student at The
					University of Texas at Dallas in Richardson, Texas. I was born and
					raised in Mesquite, Texas. I am an aspiring full-stack developer/java
					developer hoping to make an impact in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time I enjoy playing video games, browsing the web, and
					tinkering with technology. I label myself a 'Dreamer' because whilst I
					am a realist, I do believe there is good to be found in this world and
					dreaming big and having goals pushes a person to be the best they can
					be.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from technology, I am a activist for LGBTQIA, Womens, and POC
					rights. I strive to educate and advocate for marginalized voices that
					are often overlooked in the media. The world is not a perfect place,
					and there is still work to be done. And I am prepared to work hard to
					be a beacon of hope for those who feel unheard, unappreciated, and
					underrepresented.
